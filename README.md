## Introduction

Object counting is a crucial task in various fields such as traffic management, inventory control, and surveillance. This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate object counting system using YOLOv8, capable of working under various conditions.

## Features

- Real-time object detection and counting
- High accuracy with YOLOv8
- Easy to integrate with different applications
- Supports custom object datasets
- Flexible conditions for object counting

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devision789/Count-Object-With-Any-Conditions-YOLOv8-.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the object counting application, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py --source /path/to/your/video/or/images --weights /path/to/yolov8/weights
```

### Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the configuration file `config.yaml`.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model can be customized. Make sure to organize your dataset in the following structure:

```
data/
    train/
        images/
        labels/
    val/
        images/
        labels/
```

## Model Training

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --data /path/to/your/dataset --epochs 100 --batch-size 16 --img-size 640
```

This will start the training process using the dataset and configuration specified.

## Inference

To run inference on new data and count objects, use the following command:

```bash
python infer.py --source /path/to/your/video/or/images --weights /path/to/yolov8/weights --output /path/to/save/results
```

## Results

The results of the object counting will be displayed in real-time and saved to the specified output directory.
